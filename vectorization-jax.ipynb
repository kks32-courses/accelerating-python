        "Vectorization is a technique used in computer programming and numerical computing to improve the performance of code by applying operations to entire arrays or data structures instead of processing individual elements. In other words, vectorization enables the simultaneous processing of multiple data elements, which can lead to significant speedup in execution time.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach takes advantage of Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features present in modern processors, such as CPUs and GPUs. SIMD allows a single instruction to operate on multiple data elements concurrently, improving the overall throughput of the computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of numerical computing, vectorization is commonly used in libraries like NumPy, JAX, and TensorFlow, where operations are applied to entire arrays or tensors at once. This eliminates the need for explicit loops in the code and allows the underlying libraries to optimize the computation using SIMD instructions or parallel execution on GPUs and TPUs.\n",

        "\n",

        "Numpy is a the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Although Numpy is a Python package, it was not developed in Python. Rather, it is written mostly in C and consists of binary executables compiled from source code. Numpy functions are therefore generally significantly faster than the same operations performed in Python. The term \"vectorized operation\" refers to passing an entire Numpy array of known data type to an optimized, compiled C code. The example below shows a simple calculation of a harmonic function using vectorized operations compared with the same operation in a Python loop. The vectorized calculation is much faster."
